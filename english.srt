1
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,370
I can't sleep at all.

2
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,620
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World

3
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,830
Iska, how are you feeling?

4
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,540
I'm fine.

5
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,330
It's just that... I have difficulty sleeping.

6
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,450
You know, there's not much
I often get to do for you as a captain...

7
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,040
So I always try to be there
if my team needs to talk.

8
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,540
See, I knew it!

9
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,200
I knew you had that look on your face
like something was off!

10
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,660
What...? Do I?

11
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,080
Yeah, you do!

12
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,830
Go on, spill your guts to me!

13
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,910
I can't stop thinking about that battle.

14
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,120
The battle that ended in a tie?

15
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,700
Maybe it left an emotional scar inside you.

16
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,240
Like trauma?

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,580
Yeah... After going through a fierce battle,

18
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,910
you could be psychologically hurt
from your injury and fear.

19
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,490
After fighting against the Ice Calamity Witch,
it's not at all surprising.

20
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,990
Oh, and also...

21
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,040
Also?

22
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,990
Uh...

23
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,080
No, never mind.

24
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,580
Hmm... I wonder what you can do to fix this?

25
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,910
When something's bothering me, barbeque
and a good night's sleep perks me up.

26
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm not sure if I'm up for that...

27
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,990
A change in scenery would actually be good.

28
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,450
I know!

29
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,200
It's a little messy, but come in!

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,910
Your stuffed animal collection has grown.

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,910
Right? They're so cute.

32
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,410
They are.

33
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,080
Um...

34
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,660
But, uh, that's something...

35
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,870
...I shouldn't be seeing...

36
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,790
No!

37
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,240
A-Ahem.

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,490
Anyway, nothing good will come out
of being cooped up inside.

39
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,120
What you need is to go out!

40
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,120
A ticket to the opera?

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
It's a play called Tragic Love
of Female Knight Beatrix.

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,740
They perform it in the Neutral city every year.

43
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,990
I love this opera, so I bought season
tickets and have used 9 out of 10,

44
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,540
but you take the last one, Iska!

45
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,200
What? But when would I go?

46
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,330
Before the next mission!

47
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,160
Why not tomorrow?

48
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,490
Tomorrow...

49
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,870
This is captain's order, got it?!

50
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,990
Never let go of them. Those swords
are our only hope of restoring this world.

51
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,290
Iska, we're almost in Ein.

52
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,740
What? Already?

53
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,120
Well, you were fast asleep
no matter how much I talked to you.

54
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,080
Sorry.

55
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,080
It's been a while since I
had a dream about Master.

56
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,240
It was about me and Jhin going
through some intense training...

57
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
More like a nightmare, really.

58
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,700
Brings back memories.

59
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,240
You haven't dreamt about
Master Cro in forever, right?

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,910
It's probably because I haven't used
my astral swords in a while.

61
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,120
Good bye, Beatrix. I cannot be with you.

62
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,910
Good bye, Azel.

63
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,870
When we meet again, it will not be in
a church like tonight, but on a battlefield.

64
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,450
Azel, you're such an idiot... How could you...

65
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,910
Shhh, please keep it down.

66
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,370
Where is your handkerchief?

67
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,830
It's already soaking wet.

68
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,040
You're crying too much.

69
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,290
Seems the girl in front of me
is easily moved to tears.

70
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,240
I can't focus on the play.

71
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Um, why don't you take this?

72
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,870
Thank you so much.

73
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,540
Um, I apologize for getting
your handkerchief wet.

74
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,490
I would like to pay for it.

75
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,990
Oh no, please don't worry.

76
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,910
It's just a cheap handker--

77
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,540
Huh?

78
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,620
Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you here?!

79
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,830
Did you follow me here?!

80
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,040
Fine, we'll finish this once and--

81
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,120
Lady Alice! You must not!

82
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,910
This is the Neutral city!

83
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,990
What's going on?

84
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,990
Any conflict in this city
is strictly prohibited.

85
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,040
I know that.

86
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,620
If I attack him now, all Neutral cities
would turn against us.

87
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,580
That would be catastrophic.

88
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,660
But I can't believe I was
sitting in front of you.

89
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,700
No wonder I felt unsettled.

90
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,200
But you were so focused on the play,
crying your eyes out...

91
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,740
Huh?! Th-This is just sweat from my eyes!

92
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,540
You will forget what you saw here today! Okay?!

93
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,450
Lady Alice, you'll draw attention
if you raise your voice.

94
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,870
Oh, fine. We will retreat for today.

95
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,450
Good day, Iska.

96
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,240
Uh, right. Thank you.

97
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,540
Lady Alice.

98
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,450
I-It's not what you think, Rin!
It was just a force of habit!

99
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,990
I thought my heart was going to stop.

100
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,200
You took the words right out of my mouth.

101
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,660
I was afraid you were going to start a war.

102
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
He's not following us, right?

103
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,080
Right. That swordsman did not take
a step until we left the hall.

104
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,080
I still can't believe he sat right behind us.

105
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,910
We should have considered the possibility.

106
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,040
R-Right...

107
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,410
Let's just forget about this
and go have our meal.

108
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,410
There's supposed to be
a famous pasta place around here.

109
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,790
I'm sorry, but all the tables are taken.

110
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,990
If you don't mind sharing
a booked table with someone,

111
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,410
I can seat you right away.

112
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,620
That's fine.

113
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,160
Follow me, please.

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,200
Thanks.

115
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,120
Wha...?!

116
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,040
What was that for?!

117
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,290
Th-That's my--

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,240
Th-The water went down the wrong pipe...

119
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,990
Lady Alice...

120
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,790
How dare you ambush us!

121
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,160
Y-You've got it wrong!

122
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,450
Then why are you here?!

123
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,700
Because it's the closest restaurant
to the opera house...

124
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,620
And a popular one at that.

125
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,740
Besides, I had a reservation!

126
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,910
What do you think, Lady Alice?

127
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,620
He does have a point.

128
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,910
But don't let your guard down, Rin.
Stay sharp.

129
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,870
You realize I'm right here
and I can hear you?

130
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,240
Lady Alice, are you sure?

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,580
We may be in the Neutral city, but to dine
together with an Imperial soldier...

132
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,990
But it'll look like I ran away scared
if I leave now.

133
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,290
Th-That's true.

134
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,950
Anyway, let's eat--

135
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,040
M-My apologies.

136
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,660
Uhh, sorry, that was my fault...

137
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,450
Please, go ahead.

138
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,830
It's fine, you may go first.

139
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,240
I can wait.

140
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,950
You reached out for it.

141
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,660
Then let's do this.

142
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,240
Um...

143
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,870
Wh-What is it?

144
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,540
Do you know what you want?

145
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,660
Yes. Excuse me?

146
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,950
Coming!

147
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,080
Salmon and zucchini pasta with heavy cream.

148
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,950
Cooked ben cotta and light on the pasta.

149
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,910
I'll have tea with one sugar cube
after the meal, please.

150
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,200
Huh?

151
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,620
My, you two are in sync.

152
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,540
Do you know each--?

153
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,160
No!

154
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,160
Do you like pasta?

155
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,290
Me?

156
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,200
Who else would I be talking to?

157
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,790
I do. It's probably my favorite.

158
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,660
I like it with a creamy sauce like this,

159
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,410
but it's also good with a dash of ground pepper.

160
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,120
Oh, you know what you're talking about.

161
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,660
It's simple yet delicious.

162
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,120
But when it's this hot outside,
cold pasta is another good option.

163
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
Oh, right! Cold pasta is great.

164
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,490
If I see cherry tomatoes at the market,
I always make them.

165
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,490
I know! Cold tomato pasta is delicious!

166
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,450
I could eat it all summer--

167
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,450
Lady Alice.

168
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,990
It seems you've stopped eating.

169
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,290
I'm sorry, I interrupted your meal.

170
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,370
I-I'm sorry, too.

171
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,580
Also, pasta should always be cooked to al dente.

172
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,830
Such amateurs.

173
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,200
Ben cotta is the best!

174
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,660
Please keep today's events
to yourself, Lady Alice.

175
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,370
Normally, I should be reporting this
to Her Majesty.

176
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,580
We may not have fought, but we still
came across an enemy soldier.

177
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,490
I know that.

178
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,120
That's the enemy's personal item.
No reason to keep it.

179
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,370
But...

180
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,540
That swordsman is a monster.

181
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,290
He may become your biggest obstacle one day.

182
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,620
But Rin, you're to blame, too.

183
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,790
How do you mean?

184
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,870
Because you made a comment about pasta
having to be cooked to al dente,

185
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,950
Iska and I kind of formed this weird alliance...

186
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,870
I merely stated a fact.

187
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,700
Al dente is pasta at its very best.

188
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,410
No one should deny that.

189
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,830
So hardheaded!

190
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,950
Jeez, why is it so hard to fall asleep?!

191
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,040
Water... I need water!

192
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,950
So drink some. This training requires us
to run the distance while hydrating.

193
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,830
I already drank all of mine.

194
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,370
Jhin, let me just get a sip of yours!

195
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,870
You'll bloat.

196
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,450
Jhin, you're such a meanie!

197
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,950
Hiya!

198
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,200
O-Oh, it's just you, Risya.

199
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,580
Issy, Nens, Jhin-Jhin! It's been a year!

200
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,830
Risya, you're the Special Defense for
Humankind HQ's special counsel, right?

201
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,120
That's amazing.

202
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,830
It's not that big of a deal.

203
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,660
So, what kind of trouble
have you brought for us today?

204
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:36,700
Well, Mismis' unit will be under
my command for this next mission.

205
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,200
Aww...

206
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,040
What, don't like it?

207
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,830
It's just that... you're too smart, Risya.

208
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,990
I'm not sure if I'll understand
your strategies...

209
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,700
You'll be fine.

210
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,580
I reviewed your reports
of the engagement in Nelka.

211
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,200
I could tell everyone's intuitions
are still sharp.

212
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,120
Though, I heard you're
having trouble sleeping, Issy?

213
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,040
Just a little.

214
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,580
Were you not able to enjoy the opera?

215
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,120
Oh no, it was great. Thank you very much.

216
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,790
Tragic love stories like that
are good from time to time!

217
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,330
Even though Risya says it's boring...

218
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,040
I'm the type of person who
doesn't understand art and stuff.

219
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,870
Speaking of... Issy, you want this?

220
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,660
Salil Viblanc's art exhibition?

221
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,410
I won this from a subordinate in a game,
but I don't care for these things.

222
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,580
So take it, Issy.

223
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,080
Ein, huh?

224
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,410
I apologize for being late, Mother.

225
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:53,790
Alice, the other day, you mentioned
you fought against an Imperial swordsman.

226
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,790
That he was as strong as the Saint Disciples.

227
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,990
Yes.

228
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,580
The Saint Disciples protect the Emperor
and are the strongest in the Empire.

229
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,540
And you are saying he is on par with them.

230
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,240
Mother? Is something wrong?

231
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,870
Look above.

232
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,490
One hundred years ago,

233
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:20,160
the Founder fought against tens of
thousands of Imperial Army soldiers.

234
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,620
She still lives.

235
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,700
The Founder had a younger twin sister.

236
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,490
She was none other than Nebulis I.

237
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,450
The royal bloodline starts with her.
She is our ancestor.

238
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,660
Of course, the Empire never knew
that the "Grand Witch,"

239
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,450
as they fearfully called her, had a sister.

240
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:49,660
Hence, they rejoiced over the "Grand Witch's"
death when Nebulis I passed away.

241
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,870
The bind on the Founder is weakening.

242
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,540
We saw this change in the Founder when,

243
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:05,580
Alice, you fought against the swordsman
of the Empire in the Nelka forest.

244
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,450
What does that mean?

245
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,870
Astral power reacts when its host is in danger.

246
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,240
Long ago, when the Imperial Army
reached the Sovereignty,

247
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,990
there were many recordings of
astral powers reacting at once.

248
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,740
The same is true for the Founder's astral power.

249
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,290
Like a sign of her awakening.

250
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,370
Alice, does anything come to mind?

251
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,700
Awaken.

252
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,120
Many mysteries remain in regard
to the Founder's astral power.

253
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,490
I will have the Astral Institution
quickly look into this, but...

254
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,910
Alice, you shall refrain
from going to the battlefield.

255
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,330
At least until we know who
this Imperial swordsman is.

256
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,160
Understood.

257
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,200
Lady Alice, is something the matter?

258
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,040
N-No.

259
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,490
I'll try to not overthink things.

260
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,700
I've been having trouble sleeping,
so I need a change in scenery.

261
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,870
Not the Neutral city again?

262
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,990
If something like the other day happens again...

263
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,330
That was just a coincidence.
To be safe, I won't go to the opera this time.

264
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,830
This time, I should actually enjoy my break.

265
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,910
Then where to?

266
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,080
Oh my god.

267
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,870
Why are you here again?!

268
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,450
Alice? Why are you here?

269
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,200
Even the art exhibit we're going to is the same?

270
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,700
Why would an Imperial soldier
come to Neutral city this often?

271
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,580
Whatever happened to your duty
to protect the Empire?!

272
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,620
Let me just point out that Viblanc is
an impressionist artist of the Empire,

273
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,990
and that it isn't weird for me
to come see his art.

274
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,830
But should you be enjoying the art
of an Imperial artist?

275
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,490
Art has no borders.

276
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,790
That's true.

277
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,450
I think the art museum is this way.
Should we go?

278
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,240
All right.

279
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,580
Wait, no!

280
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,910
I'll go this way.

281
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,790
Hey, wait, Alice.

282
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,950
Ugh, jeez...

283
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,240
Just because it's the city of art

284
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,740
doesn't mean they just have
to clean up the main streets.

285
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,950
Rin... Help me...

286
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,790
I think I'm lost...

287
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,660
Alice?

288
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,740
Why are you here?! You're supposed
to be at the art museum!

289
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,620
I already saw most of it.

290
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,740
But I didn't see you around,
so I thought maybe you got lost.

291
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,790
I can take you.

292
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,450
W-We can't!

293
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,740
I'm the princess of the Nebulis Sovereignty,

294
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,240
and you're a swordsman of the Empire!

295
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,660
So you're a princess?

296
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,660
Well, I figured you might be.

297
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,700
There's no reason to hide it from you now.

298
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,330
Anyway, my point is we're enemies.

299
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,740
Of course it's inappropriate
to go to the art museum together.

300
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,740
We're enemies, but art has no borders.

301
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,830
Those were your words, Alice.

302
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,080
I wanted to see this piece.

303
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,370
Iska.

304
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,620
Yeah?

305
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,490
Why do you like this artist?

306
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,330
The paint right here is a little raised.

307
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,910
This is just my imagination,

308
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,740
but I think he paused when he tried
to add paint with a painting knife.

309
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,990
And here, he repainted it with
a completely different shade.

310
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,620
It makes me wonder if the image in his head
changes while he's painting.

311
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,790
Needing to paint in stronger colors,
with more passion...

312
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:25,040
This artist, Viblanc, only paints landscapes.
Cities, streets, boating docks...

313
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,950
And he never draws people in them.

314
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,080
The subject he draws is inorganic
and his colors are dark, but...

315
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
He's very passionate?

316
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Right. I can see his personality
through his art,

317
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,620
and I think that's what I like about it.

318
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,450
I get it. I feel the same--

319
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,080
Here, for showing me the way.

320
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
You don't need to do that.

321
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,910
I don't want to owe you. Especially you.

322
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,580
It wasn't a big deal.

323
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,160
I have my own money...

324
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,490
What is it?

325
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,240
Maybe I don't have enough money.

326
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,950
You're so silly.

327
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,240
I'm saying you can have it.

328
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,790
Don't worry about it.

329
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,200
So, how old are you anyway?

330
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,870
I'm 16.

331
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,830
Then I'm older than you.

332
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
What was I--?

333
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,290
We're enemies, you know?

334
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:55,330
If I... If I wanted to,
in your current state, I could...

335
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,740
Encounter

336
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,740
The Enemy You and I Met Was...

337
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,620
That is all for today's deliberation.

338
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,870
We will reinstate the Successor of the
Black Steel, Iska, back to Saint Disciple

339
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:49,290
under the condition that he captures
the Ice Calamity Witch.
